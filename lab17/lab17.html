Today I learned a lot about myself throughout the naviance surverys. I learned more about which career I should take, why it would be the best fit for me, and the salaries. I also found more about my personality whether I'm extroverted or introverted, etc. I was really surprised about my personality results since I never expected to be so extroverted. I also was very surprised about my carrer results. At first I wanted to become either a scientist or a entrepreneur. Throughout the servey they told me I should look into mental services, selling products, or graphic designing.
<br> 
Out of all the careers that were listed for me graphic designing really caught my interest. I have always been interested in arts, tech and design so I was looking forward for a career like that. When I looked in graphic designing I believe it was just an instance match for me. Graphic designing consists the development of many designs. They may create logos for businesses or products. They design brochures, ads, to promote certain businesses. The salary is $50,000-$70,000 in new york it's typically $61,000. 
<br>
I learned a lot of things about my personality. I found out I am artistic, enterprising, and realistic. Meaning, I like to do creative things such as drama, crafts, music, dance, creative writing, etc. I like to persuade and lead people. I don't like to encounter analyctic/scientific thinking. I also love to work with tools, animals, informing others etc. The survey also helped with leading me to many college majors i should insist on taking. These include, Design and Visual Communications, Industrial Design, Commercial Photography, Graphic Design, Agricultural Communication/ Journalism. Overall, I am looking forward into getting a career in graphic designing or something similar. </p>
