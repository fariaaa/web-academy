		<p>About myself: Hi! My name is Faria Hossain and I'm 14 years old. I love playing drums and I'm in to arts and crafts. I'm looking forward to try new things like creating websites and get creative. I want to learn more about webpages and how it works and designed. I took this class since I believe it would help me with fulfilling my dreams of becoming an entreprenuer </p>
		<p> I believe"h1 to h6" are different types of subtitles with different fonts and text sized and "p" would be considered a body text.</p>
